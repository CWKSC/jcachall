首先，恭喜我們的女子隊獲得了冠軍。她們從第一棒開始就處於領先地位。運動員們奔跑得快如風馳電掣，交接棒也十分流暢。到了最後一棒更是遠遠地甩開了其他對手，最終以絕對性優勢贏得了比賽。

First of all, congratulate our woman’s team won the Champion. They were in the lead from the first stage. The athletes ran as fast as the wind and lightning, and passed and received the baton smoothly. In the last stage, our team had a great lead between our and our competitor, and won the race eventually.

很可惜，因為疫情影響，其他群智人未能於現場親眼一睹運動健兒之風采並為之吶喊助威。但是，他們仍然取得了傲人的成績。這一切都離不開他們的努力訓練。我們衷心感謝他們於選拔及訓練中無私奉獻了自己的時間與精力。

Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, other Academians were not able to watch the race and cheer for the athletes in person. However, they still achieved eminent results. All of this is due to their hard work. We sincerely thank them for their time and effort devoted in the selection and training sessions.

讓我們一起向這些運動健兒致敬
